# CCB Done Tag Instructions (for Codex)
#
# Goal: distinguish "waiting for input" vs "waiting for output" reliably by
# forcing a stable completion marker in every assistant reply.
#
# Rules:
# - If the user's message contains a line like:
#     CCB_REQ_ID: <32 hex>
#   then the final line of your reply MUST be:
#     CCB_DONE: <same 32 hex>
# - Otherwise, the final line of your reply MUST be exactly:
#     CCB_DONE
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The completion line must be the very last line.
# - Do not add any extra punctuation or whitespace on that line.
