# Done Tag Instructions (codex-status)
#
# Purpose:
# - Make every turn end with a stable completion tag so external tools can tell:
#   - waiting for output (no DONE yet)
#   - waiting for input (DONE observed)
#
# Rule (always):
# - The final line of EVERY assistant reply MUST be exactly:
#     CODEX_DONE
#
# Optional (for request tracking):
# - If the user's message contains a line like:
#     CODEX_REQ_ID: <32 hex>
#   then the final line MUST be:
#     CODEX_DONE: <same 32 hex>
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The completion line must be the very last line.
# - Do not add any extra punctuation or whitespace on that line.
